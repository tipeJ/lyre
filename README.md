A Flutter application for Reddit

## What is this?

A reddit application built with [Flutter](https://flutter.io). Uses the Dart reddit Api wrapper [DRAW](https://github.com/draw-dev/DRAW).

## Release date?

Currently only has basic functionality, with some unresolved UI issues that need to be fixed before initial launch in Play Store.

## Cross-platform?

Currently developed and tested on android devices. When the basic functionality is up the application will be added to App Store. When (if) Flutter support for desktop environments becomes reality the app will be ported to Windows, macOS and Linux. Web support might or might not be added sometime in the distant future.
